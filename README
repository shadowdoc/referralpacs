This is a system used to couple .jpg digital chest radiographs with demographic information, essentially creating
a baby PACS system. This system is meant to be deployed in a resource constrained environment where traditional PACS may be unfeasable.

There are two integrations: 
  With an instance of OpenMRS - http://openmrs.org/ where OpenMRS provides demographic information through 
  REST web services.  You will need to customize the code in patient.rb to match your particular identifiers
  as OpenMRS systems support multiple identifiers.  The system also has code that will allow you to send structured
  HL7 messages to OpenMRS via REST.  Concepts are stored differently in the two systems, so there is some unfortunate
  hard coding to match them up.

  The second integration is with a dcm4chee image archive.  When present, new images trigger encounter creation in the
  referralPACS system through the lib/load_dcm4chee_studies.rb running with rails r on a cron job.  Demographic information is taken from the dcm4chee database, and history information is taken from two DICOM fields: additional patient history, and contrast information (since we're only using CXR contrast doesn't matter).  DCM4CHEE doesn't
  incorporate these two attributes into it's database by default and so the lib/dcm4chee-attribute-filter.xml needs to
  be installed on the dcm4chee server.

This is very much a work in progress, your comments/forks are welcome.
