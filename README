This is a system used to couple .jpg digital radiographs with demographic information, essentially creating
a baby PACS system.  There currently is no DICOM functionality, but there are plans to move in that direction
in the future.  This system would be useful in a resource constrained environment.

The system also includes a structured report system for reporting chest radiographs and will soon be able to 
generate HL7 messages based on the structured report as well as concepts in the concept dictionary.

This is very much a work in progress, your comments/forks are welcome.
